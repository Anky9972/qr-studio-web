        question: 'What are dynamic QR codes?',
        answer: 'Dynamic QR codes allow you to change the destination URL without reprinting the code. The QR code points to a short URL that redirects to your actual destination, which you can edit anytime from your dashboard.'
    },
    {
        question: 'How does bulk generation work?',
        answer: 'Upload a CSV or Excel file with your data, map the columns to QR code fields, and generate thousands of codes in minutes. Each code is unique and can be customized with your brand settings. Download all codes as a ZIP file.'
    },
    {
        question: 'Can I track who scans my QR codes?',
        answer: 'Yes! Our analytics show scan counts, timestamps, geographic locations (city/country), device types, browsers, and referral sources. All data is anonymized and GDPR-compliant.'
    },
    {
        question: 'Do QR codes expire?',

    },
    {
        question: 'Can I use my own domain?',
        answer: 'Yes! Business and Enterprise plans support custom domains for dynamic QR codes (e.g., qr.yourbrand.com). This provides white-label branding and increases user trust.'
